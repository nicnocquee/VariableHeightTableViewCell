Test project to show variable cell height in UITableView. But there is a weird behavior with the table view cells. If you run this project, you'll see that the first row is not properly arranged, i.e., the description label is stretched vertically. But if you scroll the table view and make that first row out of view, then scroll back up, that first cell is laid out properly.

What did I do wrong?
